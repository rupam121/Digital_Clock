# Digital_Clock
In this web project, i have create a digital clock that displays the current time on a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will allow you to learn about web development fundamentals and how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the time dynamically.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For dynamically updating and displaying the current time.
Project Steps:

Create the HTML Structure:

Begin by creating the basic structure of your web page. This will include an HTML document with a <head> and <body> section.
Inside the <body>, create a <div> element to hold the digital clock display.
Style the Clock:

Use CSS to style the digital clock. You can choose fonts, colors, and layout styles that match your design preferences.
Consider using CSS Flexbox or Grid to position and style the clock elements neatly.

Write JavaScript for Time Display:

Create a JavaScript function that fetches the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds).
Use the Date object in JavaScript to get the current time.
Format the time data into a user-friendly format (e.g., 12-hour or 24-hour format).
Update the DOM with Time:

Use JavaScript to target the HTML element where you want to display the time (e.g., the <div> element created for the clock).
Update the content of that element with the current time using the innerHTML or textContent property.
